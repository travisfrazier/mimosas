					"We decided to open Mimosas and Nails to fix the problems with the
					nail salon industry," owner Yen Tran explained. "When walking into a
					typical neighborhood salon, you are greeted with overwhelming smells
					of acrylics, long waits, fluorescent lighting, and questionable
					hygiene that completely undermines the experience. I thought to
					myself, there has to be a better way."
				</p>
				<p>
					Salon owners Yen Tran and Don Do have created the unique nail boutique
					as a way to challenge the industry. Just as Uber, Starbucks and
					Nordstroms have worked diligently to change expectations in their
					sectors, Tran believes Mimosas and Nails will do the same in the nail
					salon industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mimosas and Nails prides itself on four key pillars: simplicity by
					utilizing technology, excellence, fun, and philanthropy. Through these
					four key ideas, the salon believes it can offer something completely
					different to women and the city of Charlotte.
				</p>
				<p>
					Customers can easily book their appointments in under 30 seconds on
					the app or website. When they arrive there is no waiting. However,
					they will find a fresh signature drink waiting for them. After the
					customer enjoys his or her luxurious experience, they will walkout
					without pulling out their wallet, because their account will be
					charged automatically.
				</p>
				<p>
					The environment at Mimosas and Nails is unlike any other due to the
					“3rd Place” feel; the place between your home and office. Charging
					stations are available for your laptop or phone. The drinks will
					compare to high end wine bars and coffee shops. There are numerous
					monitors that will display social media feeds and live television.
					Customers will be able to truly have fun in the Mimosas and Nails
					selfie room and photo booth that is designed to enhance your
					experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is their desire to change the industry that has led to the salon
					donating money each month to multiple Charlotte women's foundations.
					Not only does Mimosas and Nails want to leave a mark on the beauty
					industry, but it hopes to improve the lives of women in Charlotte.
					When women invest in their beauty and well-being at Mimosas and Nails,
					they are also contributing to the wellness of others in Charlotte.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Our goal is to truly change the industry for the better and give back
					to the community that has given us a chance for freedom and the
					ability to follow our dreams," Tran said.
